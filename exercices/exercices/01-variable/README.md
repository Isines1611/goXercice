# Intro

The `var` statement declares a list of variables, the type is last. 
A `var` statement can be at package or function level. We see both in this example. 
You can initialize your variables, otherwise their will have their `zero value`.
Instead of using `var` and the type, you can use the short assignment `:=`.
